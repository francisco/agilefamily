### AgileFamily - Agile task management for families

Inspired by Bruce Feiler's [Ted talk on Agile for Families](http://on.ted.com/Feiler), I built Agilefamily with the goal of helping non-technical families leverage Agile for task management and weekly meetings.

To challenge myself, I learned AngularJS on my own and built the task manager as a one-page app entirely in AngularJS.
